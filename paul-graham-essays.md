### Billionaires Build (http://www.paulgraham.com/ace.html)

> What YC looks for, above all, is founders who understand some group of users
> and can make what they want. This is so important that it's YC's motto: "Make
> something people want."

> Which means the conversation during your YC interview will have to be about
> something new: either a new need, or a new way to satisfy one. And not just
> new, but uncertain. If it were certain that the need existed and that you
> could satisfy it, that certainty would be reflected in large and rapidly
> growing revenues, and you wouldn't be seeking seed funding.

The leap of faith is found here.

> The crucial feature of the initial market is that it exist. That may seem
> like an obvious point, but the lack of it is the biggest flaw in most startup
> ideas. There have to be some people who want what you're building right now,
> and want it so urgently that they're willing to use it, bugs and all, even
> though you're a small company they've never heard of.

> Who are your first users going to be, and how do you know they want this? If
> I had to decide whether to fund startups based on a single question, it would
> be "How do you know people want this?" ... That is a hard standard to meet,
> though. Airbnb didn't meet it. They had the first part. They had made
> something they themselves wanted. But it wasn't spreading. So don't feel bad
> if you don't hit this gold standard of convincingness. If Airbnb didn't hit
> it, it must be too high.

If knowing if people wanted it was easy, everyone would build startups.

> The best thing you can do in a YC interview is to teach the partners about
> your users. So if you want to prepare for your interview, one of the best
> ways to do it is to go talk to your users and find out exactly what they're
> thinking. Which is what you should be doing anyway.

If interviewing with early startups, when talking with founders I really should
be asking about their users.

> Competitors are rarely what kills startups. Poor execution does. But you
> should know who your competitors are, and tell the YC partners candidly what
> your relative strengths and weaknesses are. Because the YC partners know that
> competitors don't kill startups, they won't hold competitors against you too
> much. They will, however, hold it against you if you seem either to be
> unaware of competitors, or to be minimizing the threat they pose.

> The partners don't expect your idea to be perfect. This is seed investing. At
> this stage, all they can expect are promising hypotheses.

> If the partners are sufficiently convinced that there's a path to a big
> market, the next question is whether you'll be able to find it. That in turn
> depends on three things: the general qualities of the founders, their
> specific expertise in this domain, and the relationship between them. How
> determined are the founders? Are they good at building things? Are they
> resilient enough to keep going when things go wrong? How strong is their
> friendship?

> So that's what YC looks for in founders: authenticity. People's motives for
> starting startups are usually mixed. They're usually doing it from some
> combination of the desire to make money, the desire to seem cool, genuine
> interest in the problem, and unwillingness to work for someone else. The last
> two are more powerful motivators than the first two. It's ok for founders to
> want to make money or to seem cool. Most do. But if the founders seem like
> they're doing it just to make money or just to seem cool, they're not likely
> to succeed on a big scale.

> The most reliable way to become a billionaire is to start a company that
> grows fast, and the way to grow fast is to make what users want. Newly
> started startups have no choice but to delight users, or they'll never even
> get rolling.

> Users are what the partners want to know about in YC interviews, and what I
> want to know about when I talk to founders that we funded ten years ago and
> who are billionaires now. What do users want? What new things could you build
> for them? Founders who've become billionaires are always eager to talk about
> that topic. That's how they became billionaires.

### Why Nerds are Unpopular (http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html)

> I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they all tell the same
> story: there is a strong correlation between being smart and being a nerd,
> and an even stronger inverse correlation between being a nerd and being
> popular. Being smart seems to make you unpopular. Why? ... Being smart
> doesn't make you an outcast in elementary school. Nor does it harm you in the
> real world. ... But in a typical American secondary school, being smart is
> likely to make your life difficult. Why?

> Why don't smart kids make themselves popular? If they're so smart, why don't
> they figure out how popularity works and beat the system, just as they do for
> standardized tests? ... I think, is that they don't really want to be
> popular. ... There was something else I wanted more: to be smart. Not simply
> to do well in school, though that counted for something, but ... to make
> great things.

> Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison wardens.
> Wardens' main concern is to keep the prisoners on the premises. They also
> need to keep them fed, and as far as possible prevent them from killing one
> another. Beyond that, they want to have as little to do with the prisoners as
> possible, so they leave them to create whatever social organization they
> want.

> Why is the real world more hospitable to nerds? ... [Because] it's very
> large, and the things you do have real effects. When the things you do have
> real effects, it's no longer enough just to be pleasing. It starts to be
> important to get the right answers, and that's where nerds show to advantage.

> If I could go back and give my thirteen year old self some advice, the main
> thing I'd tell him would be to stick his head up and look around. I didn't
> really grasp it at the time, but the whole world we lived in was as fake as a
> Twinkie. Not just school, but the entire town.

> Adults can't avoid seeing that teenage kids are tormented. So why don't they
> do something about it? Because they blame it on puberty. ... Teenage kids
> used to have a more active role in society. In pre-industrial times, they
> were all apprentices of one sort or another ... Now adults have no immediate
> use for teenagers. They would be in the way in an office. So they drop them
> off at school on their way to work, much as they might drop the dog off at a
> kennel if they were going away for the weekend.

> The mediocrity of American public schools has worse consequences than just
> making kids unhappy for six years. It breeds a rebelliousness that actively
> drives kids away from the things they're supposed to be learning. Like many
> nerds, probably, it was years after high school before I could bring myself
> to read anything we'd been assigned then.

> Nerds aren't losers. They're just playing a different game, and a game much
> closer to the one played in the real world.

> If life seems awful to kids, it's neither because hormones are turning you
> all into monsters (as your parents believe), nor because life actually is
> awful (as you believe). It's because the adults, who no longer have any
> economic use for you, have abandoned you to spend years cooped up together
> with nothing real to do. Any society of that type is awful to live in. You
> don't have to look any further to explain why teenage kids are unhappy.

### How to Make Wealth (http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html)

> If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best bet would
> be to start or join a startup. That's been a reliable way to get rich for
> hundreds of years. The Proposition

> Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole
> working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for
> forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four.

> It's not a good idea to use famous rich people as examples, because the press
> only write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers. Bill Gates
> is a smart, determined, and hardworking man, but you need more than that to
> make as much money as he has. You also need to be very lucky.

> There are plenty of other ways to get money, including chance, speculation,
> marriage, inheritance, theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly, graft, lobbying,
> counterfeiting, and prospecting. Most of the greatest fortunes have probably
> involved several of these. The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get
> rich, is not just that it's more legitimate (many of the other methods are
> now illegal) but that it's more straightforward. You just have to do
> something people want.

> If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is. Wealth
> is not the same thing as money. Wealth is the fundamental thing. Wealth is
> stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting
> places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. Wealth is what
> you want, not money. But if wealth is the important thing, why does everyone
> talk about making money? It is a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving
> wealth, and in practice they are usually interchangeable.

> The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be created are the ones who
> are good at making things, the craftsmen. But with the rise of
> industrialization there are fewer and fewer craftsmen. One of the biggest
> remaining groups is computer programmers. A programmer can sit down in front
> of a computer and create wealth. A good piece of software is, in itself, a
> valuable thing. There is no manufacturing to confuse the issue. Those
> characters you type are a complete, finished product.

> In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a lot of other
> people's. You may not even be aware you're doing something people want. Your
> contribution may be indirect. But the company as a whole must be giving
> people something they want, or they won't make any money. And if they are
> paying you x dollars a year, then on average you must be contributing at
> least x dollars a year worth of work, or the company will be spending more
> than it makes, and will go out of business. ... That averaging gets to be a
> problem. I think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the
> difficulty of assigning a value to each person's work. For the most part they
> punt. In a big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working
> fairly hard.  ... Salesmen are an exception. It's easy to measure how much
> revenue they generate, and they're usually paid a percentage of it. ... A
> company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly would be
> enormously successful. Many employees would work harder if they could get
> paid for it. More importantly, such a company would attract people who wanted
> to work especially hard. It would crush its competitors.

> To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things,
> measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance
> can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you
> have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big
> effect. ... All you need to do is be part of a small group working on a hard
> problem.

> If you can't measure the value of the work done by individual employees, you
> can get close. You can measure the value of the work done by small groups.
> ... One level at which you can accurately measure the revenue generated by
> employees is at the level of the whole company. When the company is small,
> you are thereby fairly close to measuring the contributions of individual
> employees. A viable startup might only have ten employees, which puts you
> within a factor of ten of measuring individual effort. ... [thus] starting or
> joining a startup is thus as close as most people can get.

> That's the real point of startups. Ideally, you are getting together with a
> group of other people who also want to work a lot harder, and get paid a lot
> more, than they would in a big company. And because startups tend to get
> founded by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already know one
> another (at least by reputation), the level of measurement is more precise
> than you get from smallness alone. A startup is not merely ten people, but
> ten people like you.

> Startups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with measurement and
> leverage. They allow measurement because they're small, and they offer
> leverage because they make money by inventing new technology.

> What is technology? It's technique. It's the way we all do things. And when
> you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied by all the
> people who use it. ... If you solve a technical problem that a lot of people
> care about, you help everyone who uses your solution. That's leverage.

> Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall aim of your
> company, but also at decision points along the way. ... we deliberately
> sought hard problems. If there were two features we could add to our
> software, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty, we'd
> always take the harder one. Not just because it was more valuable, but
> because it was harder ... something that was hard for us would be impossible
> for our competitors.

> Unfortunately there are a couple catches. One is that you can't choose the
> point on the curve that you want to inhabit. You can't decide, for example,
> that you'd like to work just two or three times as hard, and get paid that
> much more. ... The other catch is that the payoff is only on average
> proportionate to your productivity. ... So in practice the deal is not that
> you're 30 times as productive and get paid 30 times as much. It is that
> you're 30 times as productive, and get paid between zero and a thousand times
> as much.

> It's common for a startup to be developing a genuinely good product, take
> slightly too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.

> Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition. And you
> don't generally know which of the two you're going to get till the last
> minute.

> Users are the only real proof that you've created wealth. Wealth is what
> people want, and if people aren't using your software, maybe it's not just
> because you're bad at marketing. Maybe it's because you haven't made what
> they want.

> In a startup, you're not just trying to solve problems. You're trying to
> solve problems that users care about.

> Treating a startup as an optimization problem will help you avoid another
> pitfall ... taking a long time to develop a product. ... Get a version 1.0
> out there as soon as you can. Until you have some users to measure, you're
> optimizing based on guesses.

> The underlying principle [is] that wealth is what people want. If you plan to
> get rich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want. So few
> businesses really pay attention to making customers happy.

### How People Get Rich Now (http://www.paulgraham.com/richnow.html)

> Every year since 1982, Forbes magazine has published a list of the richest
> Americans. If we compare the 100 richest people in 1982 to the 100 richest in
> 2020, we notice some big differences. ... How are people making these new
> fortunes? Roughly 3/4 by starting companies and 1/4 by investing. Of the 73
> new fortunes in 2020, 56 derive from founders' or early employees' equity.

> By 2020 the biggest source of new wealth was what are sometimes called "tech"
> companies. Of the 73 new fortunes, about 30 derive from such companies. These
> are particularly common among the richest of the rich: 8 of the top 10
> fortunes in 2020 were new fortunes of this type.

> It's easier now to start and grow a company than it has ever been. That means
> more people start them, that those who do get better terms from investors,
> and that the resulting companies become more valuable.

### How to Start a Startup (http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html)

> You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good
> people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little
> money as possible. Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of
> these. A startup that does all three will probably succeed.

> In particular, you don't need a brilliant idea to start a startup around. The
> way a startup makes money is to offer people better technology than they have
> now. But what people have now is often so bad that it doesn't take brilliance
> to do better.

> I can think of several heuristics for generating ideas for startups, but most
> reduce to this: look at something people are trying to do, and figure out how
> to do it in a way that doesn't suck.

> Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the trouble is,
> they're not transferrable. They're not something you could hand to someone
> else to execute. Their value is mainly as starting points: as questions for
> the people who had them to continue thinking about. What matters is not
> ideas, but the people who have them. Good people can fix bad ideas, but good
> ideas can't save bad people.

> One of the best tricks I learned during our startup was a rule for deciding
> who to hire. Could you describe the person as an animal? ... It means someone
> who takes their work a little too seriously; someone who does what they do so
> well that they pass right through professional and cross over into obsessive.

> Like most startups, ours began with a group of friends, and it was through
> personal contacts that we got most of the people we hired. This is a crucial
> difference between startups and big companies. Being friends with someone for
> even a couple days will tell you more than companies could ever learn in
> interviews.

> Business was no great mystery. It's not something like physics or medicine
> that requires extensive study. You just try to get people to pay you for
> stuff.

> In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers didn't
> want the product. ... The only way to make something customers want is to get
> a prototype in front of them and refine it based on their reactions.

> It's worth trying very, very hard to make technology easy to use. Hackers are
> so used to computers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems to
> normal people.

> How do you figure out what customers want? Watch them. One of the best places
> to do this was at trade shows. Trade shows didn't pay as a way of getting new
> customers, but they were worth it as market research.

> No matter what kind of startup you start, it will probably be a stretch for
> you, the founders, to understand what users want. The only kind of software
> you can build without studying users is the sort for which you are the
> typical user. ... If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable
> things you could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a
> couple weeks just watching what they do with computers. Most good hackers
> have no more idea of the horrors perpetrated in these places than rich
> Americans do of what goes on in Brazilian slums.

> Financially, a startup is like a pass/fail course. The way to get rich from a
> startup is to maximize the company's chances of succeeding, not to maximize
> the amount of stock you retain. So if you can trade stock for something that
> improves your odds, it's probably a smart move.

> The first thing you'll need is a few tens of thousands of dollars to pay your
> expenses while you develop a prototype. This is called seed capital. Because
> so little money is involved, raising seed capital is comparatively easy-- at
> least in the sense of getting a quick yes or no. Usually you get seed money
> from individual rich people called "angels." Often they're people who
> themselves got rich from technology. At the seed stage, investors don't
> expect you to have an elaborate business plan. Most know that they're
> supposed to decide quickly. It's not unusual to get a check within a week
> based on a half-page agreement.

> When and if you get an infusion of real money from investors, what should you
> do with it? Not spend it, that's what. In nearly every startup that fails,
> the proximate cause is running out of money. Usually there is something
> deeper wrong. But even a proximate cause of death is worth trying hard to
> avoid.

> There is nothing more valuable, in the early stages of a startup, than smart
> users. If you listen to them, they'll tell you exactly how to make a winning
> product. And not only will they give you this advice for free, they'll pay
> you.

> To make something users love, you have to understand them. And the bigger you
> are, the harder that is. So I say "get big slow." The slower you burn through
> your funding, the more time you have to learn.

> When you get a couple million dollars from a VC firm, you tend to feel rich.
> It's important to realize you're not. A rich company is one with large
> revenues. This money isn't revenue. It's money investors have given you in
> the hope you'll be able to generate revenues. So despite those millions in
> the bank, you're still poor.

> So who should start a startup? Someone who is a good hacker, between about 23
> and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one shot instead of
> getting paid gradually over a conventional working life.

> Do you actually want to start a startup? What it amounts to, economically, is
> compressing your working life into the smallest possible space. Instead of
> working at an ordinary rate for 40 years, you work like hell for four. ...
> During this time you'll do little but work, because when you're not working,
> your competitors will be. My only leisure activities were running, which I
> needed to do to keep working anyway, and about fifteen minutes of reading a
> night.

> I don't think the amount of bullshit you have to deal with in a startup is
> more than you'd endure in an ordinary working life. It's probably less, in
> fact; it just seems like a lot because it's compressed into a short period.
> So mainly what a startup buys you is time. That's the way to think about it
> if you're trying to decide whether to start one. If you're the sort of person
> who would like to solve the money problem once and for all instead of working
> for a salary for 40 years, then a startup makes sense.

> If you want to do it, do it. Starting a startup is not the great mystery it
> seems from outside. It's not something you have to know about "business" to
> do. Build something users love, and spend less than you make. How hard is
> that?

### Ideas for Startups (http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html)

> How do you get good ideas for startups? That's probably the number one
> question people ask me. I'd like to reply with another question: why do
> people think it's hard to come up with ideas for startups?

> Startup ideas are not million dollar ideas, and here's an experiment you can
> try to prove it: just try to sell one. Nothing evolves faster than markets.
> The fact that there's no market for startup ideas suggests there's no demand.
> Which means, in the narrow sense of the word, that startup ideas are
> worthless.

> The initial idea is just a starting point-- not a blueprint, but a question.
> It might help if they were expressed that way. Instead of saying that your
> idea is to make a collaborative, web-based spreadsheet, say: could one make a
> collaborative, web-based spreadsheet? A few grammatical tweaks, and a
> woefully incomplete idea becomes a promising question to explore.

> Treating a startup idea as a question changes what you're looking for. If an
> idea is a blueprint, it has to be right. But if it's a question, it can be
> wrong, so long as it's wrong in a way that leads to more ideas.

> To generate such questions you need two things: to be familiar with promising
> new technologies, and to have the right kind of friends. New technologies are
> the ingredients startup ideas are made of, and conversations with friends are
> the kitchen they're cooked in.

> Stay upwind for as long as you can, then cash in the potential energy you've
> accumulated when you need to pay for kids.

> It's obvious why you want exposure to new technology, but why do you need
> other people? Can't you just think of new ideas yourself? The empirical
> answer is: no. Even Einstein needed people to bounce ideas off. Ideas get
> developed in the process of explaining them to the right kind of person. You
> need that resistance, just as a carver needs the resistance of the wood.

> What these groups of co-founders do together is more complicated than just
> sitting down and trying to think of ideas. I suspect the most productive
> setup is a kind of together-alone-together sandwich. Together you talk about
> some hard problem, probably getting nowhere. Then, the next morning, one of
> you has an idea in the shower about how to solve it. He runs eagerly to to
> tell the others, and together they work out the kinks.

> I find that to have good ideas I need to be working on some problem. You
> can't start with randomness. You have to start with a problem, then let your
> mind wander just far enough for new ideas to form.

> In a way, it's harder to see problems than their solutions. Most people
> prefer to remain in denial about problems. It's obvious why: problems are
> irritating.

> Let me repeat that recipe: finding the problem intolerable and feeling it
> must be possible to solve it. Simple as it seems, that's the recipe for a lot
> of startup ideas.

> What's special about startup ideas? Startup ideas are ideas for companies,
> and companies have to make money. And the way to make money is to make
> something people want.

> It seems like it violates some kind of conservation law, but there it is: the
> best way to get a "million dollar idea" is just to do what hackers enjoy
> doing anyway.

### How to Get Startup Ideas (http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)

> The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to
> look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself. The very best
> startup ideas tend to have three things in common: they're something the
> founders themselves want, that they themselves can build, and that few others
> realize are worth doing.

> Why do so many founders build things no one wants? Because they begin by
> trying to think of startup ideas. That m.o. is doubly dangerous: it doesn't
> merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad ideas that sound plausible enough
> to fool you into working on them.

> When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now?
> Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version
> one made by a two-person startup they've never heard of? If you can't answer
> that, the idea is probably bad.

> How do you tell whether there's a path out of an idea? How do you tell
> whether something is the germ of a giant company, or just a niche product?
> Often you can't. So if you can't predict whether there's a path out of an
> idea, how do you choose between ideas? The truth is disappointing but
> interesting: if you're the right sort of person, you have the right sort of
> hunches. If you're at the leading edge of a field that's changing fast, when
> you have a hunch that something is worth doing, you're more likely to be
> right.

> The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not "think up"
> but "notice."

> Once you're living in the future in some respect, the way to notice startup
> ideas is to look for things that seem to be missing. If you're really at the
> leading edge of a rapidly changing field, there will be things that are
> obviously missing. What won't be obvious is that they're startup ideas.

> Give yourself some time. You have a lot of control over the rate at which you
> turn yours into a prepared mind, but you have less control over the stimuli
> that spark ideas when they hit it.

> A good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on projects that
> seem like they'd be cool. If you do that, you'll naturally tend to build
> things that are missing. It wouldn't seem as interesting to build something
> that already existed.

> Err on the side of doing things where you'll face competitors. Inexperienced
> founders usually give competitors more credit than they deserve. Whether you
> succeed depends far more on you than on your competitors. So better a good
> idea with competitors than a bad one without.

> You don't need to worry about entering a "crowded market" so long as you have
> a thesis about what everyone else in it is overlooking. In fact that's a very
> promising starting point.

> There are two more filters you'll need to turn off if you want to notice
> startup ideas: the unsexy filter and the schlep filter.

Schlep filter is avoiding laborious work -- keeps you from problems you fear.

Unsexy filter is avoiding  work you despise.

> While the best way to discover startup ideas is to become the sort of person
> who has them and then build whatever interests you, sometimes you don't have
> that luxury. Sometimes you need an idea now.

> One of the biggest dangers of not using the organic method is the example of
> the organic method. Organic ideas feel like inspirations. There are a lot of
> stories about successful startups that began when the founders had what
> seemed a crazy idea but "just knew" it was promising. When you feel that
> about an idea you've had while trying to come up with startup ideas, you're
> probably mistaken.

> The place to start looking for ideas is things you need. There must be things
> you need.

> A good trick for bypassing the schlep and to some extent the unsexy filter is
> to ask what you wish someone else would build, so that you could use it. What
> would you pay for right now?

> Finding startup ideas is a subtle business, and that's why most people who
> try fail so miserably. It doesn't work well simply to try to think of startup
> ideas. If you do that, you get bad ones that sound dangerously plausible. The
> best approach is more indirect: if you have the right sort of background,
> good startup ideas will seem obvious to you. But even then, not immediately.
> It takes time to come across situations where you notice something missing.
> And often these gaps won't seem to be ideas for companies, just things that
> would be interesting to build. Which is why it's good to have the time and
> the inclination to build things just because they're interesting.

> Live in the future and build what seems interesting. Strange as it sounds,
> that's the real recipe.
