### Billionaires Build (http://www.paulgraham.com/ace.html)

> What YC looks for, above all, is founders who understand some group of users
> and can make what they want. This is so important that it's YC's motto: "Make
> something people want."

> Which means the conversation during your YC interview will have to be about
> something new: either a new need, or a new way to satisfy one. And not just
> new, but uncertain. If it were certain that the need existed and that you
> could satisfy it, that certainty would be reflected in large and rapidly
> growing revenues, and you wouldn't be seeking seed funding.

The leap of faith is found here.

> The crucial feature of the initial market is that it exist. That may seem
> like an obvious point, but the lack of it is the biggest flaw in most startup
> ideas. There have to be some people who want what you're building right now,
> and want it so urgently that they're willing to use it, bugs and all, even
> though you're a small company they've never heard of.

> Who are your first users going to be, and how do you know they want this? If
> I had to decide whether to fund startups based on a single question, it would
> be "How do you know people want this?" ... That is a hard standard to meet,
> though. Airbnb didn't meet it. They had the first part. They had made
> something they themselves wanted. But it wasn't spreading. So don't feel bad
> if you don't hit this gold standard of convincingness. If Airbnb didn't hit
> it, it must be too high.

If knowing if people wanted it was easy, everyone would build startups.

> The best thing you can do in a YC interview is to teach the partners about
> your users. So if you want to prepare for your interview, one of the best
> ways to do it is to go talk to your users and find out exactly what they're
> thinking. Which is what you should be doing anyway.

If interviewing with early startups, when talking with founders I really should
be asking about their users.

> Competitors are rarely what kills startups. Poor execution does. But you
> should know who your competitors are, and tell the YC partners candidly what
> your relative strengths and weaknesses are. Because the YC partners know that
> competitors don't kill startups, they won't hold competitors against you too
> much. They will, however, hold it against you if you seem either to be
> unaware of competitors, or to be minimizing the threat they pose.

> The partners don't expect your idea to be perfect. This is seed investing. At
> this stage, all they can expect are promising hypotheses.

> If the partners are sufficiently convinced that there's a path to a big
> market, the next question is whether you'll be able to find it. That in turn
> depends on three things: the general qualities of the founders, their
> specific expertise in this domain, and the relationship between them. How
> determined are the founders? Are they good at building things? Are they
> resilient enough to keep going when things go wrong? How strong is their
> friendship?

> So that's what YC looks for in founders: authenticity. People's motives for
> starting startups are usually mixed. They're usually doing it from some
> combination of the desire to make money, the desire to seem cool, genuine
> interest in the problem, and unwillingness to work for someone else. The last
> two are more powerful motivators than the first two. It's ok for founders to
> want to make money or to seem cool. Most do. But if the founders seem like
> they're doing it just to make money or just to seem cool, they're not likely
> to succeed on a big scale.

> The most reliable way to become a billionaire is to start a company that
> grows fast, and the way to grow fast is to make what users want. Newly
> started startups have no choice but to delight users, or they'll never even
> get rolling.

> Users are what the partners want to know about in YC interviews, and what I
> want to know about when I talk to founders that we funded ten years ago and
> who are billionaires now. What do users want? What new things could you build
> for them? Founders who've become billionaires are always eager to talk about
> that topic. That's how they became billionaires.

### Why Nerds are Unpopular (http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html)

> I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they all tell the same
> story: there is a strong correlation between being smart and being a nerd,
> and an even stronger inverse correlation between being a nerd and being
> popular. Being smart seems to make you unpopular. Why? ... Being smart
> doesn't make you an outcast in elementary school. Nor does it harm you in the
> real world. ... But in a typical American secondary school, being smart is
> likely to make your life difficult. Why?

> Why don't smart kids make themselves popular? If they're so smart, why don't
> they figure out how popularity works and beat the system, just as they do for
> standardized tests? ... I think, is that they don't really want to be
> popular. ... There was something else I wanted more: to be smart. Not simply
> to do well in school, though that counted for something, but ... to make
> great things.

> Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison wardens.
> Wardens' main concern is to keep the prisoners on the premises. They also
> need to keep them fed, and as far as possible prevent them from killing one
> another. Beyond that, they want to have as little to do with the prisoners as
> possible, so they leave them to create whatever social organization they
> want.

> Why is the real world more hospitable to nerds? ... [Because] it's very
> large, and the things you do have real effects. When the things you do have
> real effects, it's no longer enough just to be pleasing. It starts to be
> important to get the right answers, and that's where nerds show to advantage.

> If I could go back and give my thirteen year old self some advice, the main
> thing I'd tell him would be to stick his head up and look around. I didn't
> really grasp it at the time, but the whole world we lived in was as fake as a
> Twinkie. Not just school, but the entire town.

> Adults can't avoid seeing that teenage kids are tormented. So why don't they
> do something about it? Because they blame it on puberty. ... Teenage kids
> used to have a more active role in society. In pre-industrial times, they
> were all apprentices of one sort or another ... Now adults have no immediate
> use for teenagers. They would be in the way in an office. So they drop them
> off at school on their way to work, much as they might drop the dog off at a
> kennel if they were going away for the weekend.

> The mediocrity of American public schools has worse consequences than just
> making kids unhappy for six years. It breeds a rebelliousness that actively
> drives kids away from the things they're supposed to be learning. Like many
> nerds, probably, it was years after high school before I could bring myself
> to read anything we'd been assigned then.

> Nerds aren't losers. They're just playing a different game, and a game much
> closer to the one played in the real world.

> If life seems awful to kids, it's neither because hormones are turning you
> all into monsters (as your parents believe), nor because life actually is
> awful (as you believe). It's because the adults, who no longer have any
> economic use for you, have abandoned you to spend years cooped up together
> with nothing real to do. Any society of that type is awful to live in. You
> don't have to look any further to explain why teenage kids are unhappy.

### How to Make Wealth (http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html)

> If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best bet would
> be to start or join a startup. That's been a reliable way to get rich for
> hundreds of years. The Proposition

> Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole
> working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for
> forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four.

> It's not a good idea to use famous rich people as examples, because the press
> only write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers. Bill Gates
> is a smart, determined, and hardworking man, but you need more than that to
> make as much money as he has. You also need to be very lucky.

> There are plenty of other ways to get money, including chance, speculation,
> marriage, inheritance, theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly, graft, lobbying,
> counterfeiting, and prospecting. Most of the greatest fortunes have probably
> involved several of these. The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get
> rich, is not just that it's more legitimate (many of the other methods are
> now illegal) but that it's more straightforward. You just have to do
> something people want.

> If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is. Wealth
> is not the same thing as money. Wealth is the fundamental thing. Wealth is
> stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting
> places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. Wealth is what
> you want, not money. But if wealth is the important thing, why does everyone
> talk about making money? It is a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving
> wealth, and in practice they are usually interchangeable.

> The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be created are the ones who
> are good at making things, the craftsmen. But with the rise of
> industrialization there are fewer and fewer craftsmen. One of the biggest
> remaining groups is computer programmers. A programmer can sit down in front
> of a computer and create wealth. A good piece of software is, in itself, a
> valuable thing. There is no manufacturing to confuse the issue. Those
> characters you type are a complete, finished product.

> In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a lot of other
> people's. You may not even be aware you're doing something people want. Your
> contribution may be indirect. But the company as a whole must be giving
> people something they want, or they won't make any money. And if they are
> paying you x dollars a year, then on average you must be contributing at
> least x dollars a year worth of work, or the company will be spending more
> than it makes, and will go out of business. ... That averaging gets to be a
> problem. I think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the
> difficulty of assigning a value to each person's work. For the most part they
> punt. In a big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working
> fairly hard.  ... Salesmen are an exception. It's easy to measure how much
> revenue they generate, and they're usually paid a percentage of it. ... A
> company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly would be
> enormously successful. Many employees would work harder if they could get
> paid for it. More importantly, such a company would attract people who wanted
> to work especially hard. It would crush its competitors.

> To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things,
> measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance
> can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you
> have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big
> effect. ... All you need to do is be part of a small group working on a hard
> problem.

> If you can't measure the value of the work done by individual employees, you
> can get close. You can measure the value of the work done by small groups.
> ... One level at which you can accurately measure the revenue generated by
> employees is at the level of the whole company. When the company is small,
> you are thereby fairly close to measuring the contributions of individual
> employees. A viable startup might only have ten employees, which puts you
> within a factor of ten of measuring individual effort. ... [thus] starting or
> joining a startup is thus as close as most people can get.

> That's the real point of startups. Ideally, you are getting together with a
> group of other people who also want to work a lot harder, and get paid a lot
> more, than they would in a big company. And because startups tend to get
> founded by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already know one
> another (at least by reputation), the level of measurement is more precise
> than you get from smallness alone. A startup is not merely ten people, but
> ten people like you.

> Startups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with measurement and
> leverage. They allow measurement because they're small, and they offer
> leverage because they make money by inventing new technology.

> What is technology? It's technique. It's the way we all do things. And when
> you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied by all the
> people who use it. ... If you solve a technical problem that a lot of people
> care about, you help everyone who uses your solution. That's leverage.

> Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall aim of your
> company, but also at decision points along the way. ... we deliberately
> sought hard problems. If there were two features we could add to our
> software, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty, we'd
> always take the harder one. Not just because it was more valuable, but
> because it was harder ... something that was hard for us would be impossible
> for our competitors.

> Unfortunately there are a couple catches. One is that you can't choose the
> point on the curve that you want to inhabit. You can't decide, for example,
> that you'd like to work just two or three times as hard, and get paid that
> much more. ... The other catch is that the payoff is only on average
> proportionate to your productivity. ... So in practice the deal is not that
> you're 30 times as productive and get paid 30 times as much. It is that
> you're 30 times as productive, and get paid between zero and a thousand times
> as much.

> It's common for a startup to be developing a genuinely good product, take
> slightly too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.

> Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition. And you
> don't generally know which of the two you're going to get till the last
> minute.

> Users are the only real proof that you've created wealth. Wealth is what
> people want, and if people aren't using your software, maybe it's not just
> because you're bad at marketing. Maybe it's because you haven't made what
> they want.

> In a startup, you're not just trying to solve problems. You're trying to
> solve problems that users care about.

> Treating a startup as an optimization problem will help you avoid another
> pitfall ... taking a long time to develop a product. ... Get a version 1.0
> out there as soon as you can. Until you have some users to measure, you're
> optimizing based on guesses.

> The underlying principle [is] that wealth is what people want. If you plan to
> get rich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want. So few
> businesses really pay attention to making customers happy.

### How People Get Rich Now (http://www.paulgraham.com/richnow.html)

> Every year since 1982, Forbes magazine has published a list of the richest
> Americans. If we compare the 100 richest people in 1982 to the 100 richest in
> 2020, we notice some big differences. ... How are people making these new
> fortunes? Roughly 3/4 by starting companies and 1/4 by investing. Of the 73
> new fortunes in 2020, 56 derive from founders' or early employees' equity.

> By 2020 the biggest source of new wealth was what are sometimes called "tech"
> companies. Of the 73 new fortunes, about 30 derive from such companies. These
> are particularly common among the richest of the rich: 8 of the top 10
> fortunes in 2020 were new fortunes of this type.

> It's easier now to start and grow a company than it has ever been. That means
> more people start them, that those who do get better terms from investors,
> and that the resulting companies become more valuable.
