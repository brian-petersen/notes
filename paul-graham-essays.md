> What YC looks for, above all, is founders who understand
> some group of users and can make what they want. This is
> so important that it's YC's motto: "Make something people want."

> Which means the conversation during your YC interview will
> have to be about something new: either a new need, or a new
> way to satisfy one. And not just new, but uncertain. If it
> were certain that the need existed and that you could satisfy it,
> that certainty would be reflected in large and rapidly growing
> revenues, and you wouldn't be seeking seed funding.

> The crucial feature of the initial market is that it exist.
> That may seem like an obvious point, but the lack of it is
> the biggest flaw in most startup ideas. There have to be some
> people who want what you're building right now, and want it so
> urgently that they're willing to use it, bugs and all, even
> though you're a small company they've never heard of.

> Who are your first users going to be, and how do you know they
> want this? If I had to decide whether to fund startups based on
> a single question, it would be "How do you know people want this?"
> ... That is a hard standard to meet, though. Airbnb didn't meet it.
> They had the first part. They had made something they themselves wanted.
> But it wasn't spreading. So don't feel bad if you don't hit this gold
> standard of convincingness. If Airbnb didn't hit it, it must be too high.

> The best thing you can do in a YC interview is to teach the partners
> about your users. So if you want to prepare for your interview,
> one of the best ways to do it is to go talk to your users and find out
> exactly what they're thinking. Which is what you should be doing anyway.

> Competitors are rarely what kills startups. Poor execution does.
> But you should know who your competitors are, and tell the YC partners
> candidly what your relative strengths and weaknesses are. Because the YC
> partners know that competitors don't kill startups, they won't hold competitors
> against you too much. They will, however, hold it against you if you seem
> either to be unaware of competitors, or to be minimizing the threat they pose.

> The partners don't expect your idea to be perfect. This is seed investing.
> At this stage, all they can expect are promising hypotheses.

> If the partners are sufficiently convinced that there's a path to a
> big market, the next question is whether you'll be able to find it.
> That in turn depends on three things: the general qualities of the founders,
> their specific expertise in this domain, and the relationship between them.
> How determined are the founders? Are they good at building things?
> Are they resilient enough to keep going when things go wrong?
> How strong is their friendship?

> So that's what YC looks for in founders: authenticity. People's
> motives for starting startups are usually mixed. They're usually
> doing it from some combination of the desire to make money, the
> desire to seem cool, genuine interest in the problem, and unwillingness
> to work for someone else. The last two are more powerful motivators than
> the first two. It's ok for founders to want to make money or to seem cool.
> Most do. But if the founders seem like they're doing it just to make money
> or just to seem cool, they're not likely to succeed on a big scale.

> The most reliable way to become a billionaire is to start a company
> that grows fast, and the way to grow fast is to make what users want.
> Newly started startups have no choice but to delight users, or they'll
> never even get rolling.

> Users are what the partners want to know about in YC interviews,
> and what I want to know about when I talk to founders that we funded
> ten years ago and who are billionaires now. What do users want?
> What new things could you build for them? Founders who've become
> billionaires are always eager to talk about that topic. That's how
> they became billionaires.
